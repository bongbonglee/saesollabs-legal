    <p>We do not sell your personal information to any third party.</p>

    <h2>4. Advertising and Tracking</h2>
    <p>Our App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. On iOS, we request your permission through Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework before collecting your advertising identifier for personalized ads.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>If you allow tracking:</strong> You may see personalized ads based on your interests and activity.</li>
        <li><strong>If you deny tracking:</strong> You will see contextual (non-personalized) ads that are not based on your activity or interests.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can change your tracking preference at any time in your device's Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking.</p>
    <p>Google AdMob uses technologies including SKAdNetwork for ad attribution without identifying individual users. A list of ad network identifiers used is included in the App's configuration.</p>

        <li>Passwords are never stored in plain text</li>
        <li>We do not store payment or credit card information directly — all payment processing is handled by Apple App Store and Google Play Store through RevenueCat</li>
        <li>Database access is restricted and monitored</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
